This program doesn't come with a license. Use at your own peril. 

In order to use this set of programs you must first run webstuff_getall_house and webstuff_getall_senate to populate the relevent PDF minutes. After this, you will need to run CommProcessor to populate the easily searchable text files. 

Then you may go up one directory to run the Search_comte file. It will ask you for search terms. Be explicit, case matters right now, and there is no handling for similar phrases.

Also, if you have searched a given term already, the program will fail to run as it cannot make another directory in the results file. Move any in-progress folders to another directory if you want to re-run a query.
